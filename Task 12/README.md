# Task 12

The task is stolen from [here](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/14/23-file-overlap.html).

Given two lists, find the numbers that are overlapping. `primenumbers.txt` file has a list of all [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) under 1000, and the other `happynumbers.txt` file has a list of [happy numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number) up to 1000 (yeah, it's a thing, apparently).

`overlaps.py` contains 3 functions that take two file names that contain numbers lists. All of them should do the same thing, but using different methods - using python and no packages, using `numpy` and using `pandas`.

`run.py` runs all three functions and prints exection time.

Feel free to change any files in here if you want, but it should work if you just populate the functions in `overlaps.py`.
