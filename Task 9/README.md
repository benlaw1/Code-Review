The task is to make a tic tac toe game for two players and use a class.
Here is [an article on python classes](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/), but there are many more.

As usual, run the task using `run.py`.

`ttt_board.py` contains a python class that is supposed to contain information about the board (3 by 3) and some functions change/access the board.
This is the file you want to change the most.
All you need to do is to fill up the functions, but feel free to change things around as you wish.

Description of how this works:

`run.py` runs a in while loop until the end of the game, showing the board, reading a number from numpad (where to put 'X' or 'O'), changing the board object accordingly and repeating this for the other player.
`ttt_board.py` contains an array with the board (one dimentional or 3 by 3 matrix, you choose)
The functions are described in the file.
